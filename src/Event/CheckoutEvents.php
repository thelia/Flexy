 * Browser-side LiveComponent event names shared by the checkout components.

 * Alongside these, the checkout uses one unnamed event: 'updateNextButton'. It carries
 * no argument and means "something the next button depends on has changed" — a delivery
 * choice, an invoice address, a pickup point, a consent box. Every component that
 * changes such a thing emits it and NextButton listens to it, which is why a new one
 * of those does not need an event of its own here.
